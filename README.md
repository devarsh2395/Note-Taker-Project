## Description

This note-taking app allows small business owners to write and save notes. The landing page provides a link to the notes page where existing notes are displayed in the left-hand column. Users can add new notes by entering the note title and text in the empty fields on the right-hand column. After entering the new note, a Save icon appears on the top navigation bar. Clicking on the Save icon saves the note, and it appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
